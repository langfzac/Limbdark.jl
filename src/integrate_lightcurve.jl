# and the limb-darkening parameters.

# trans:  structure which holds the parameters describing the transit

#   tol:  tolerance for computing the integration
# maxdepth:  maximum depth allowed for the adaptive Simpson integration
# neval_t:  number of evaluations for each time step
# depthmax:  maximum depth reached for each timestep
